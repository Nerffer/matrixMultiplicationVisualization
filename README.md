# Visualization of Matrix Multiplication with D3.js

## 1- Problem Definition
The aim of this study is to develop a web application that **visualizes matrix multiplication** step by step using **D3.js**.

## 2- Technologies Used
The following technologies have been used in this project:

**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**: For page layout and interactivity.
**D3.js**: To animate and color matrix cells.

## 3- Application Process

### 3.1 Matrix Creation

- **The matrix dimensions** are taken from the user.
- Matrices are created **with random numbers**.
- The matrices are displayed on the screen **as an HTML table**.

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Multiplication Animation

1. The numbers to be multiplied are colored at each step.
2. The result matrix (C) is filled step by step.
3. The animation is carried out sequentially using setTimeout().

## 4- Results and Evaluation

- **Matrix multiplication was followed step by step**.
- The **visualization made it more understandable** than just seeing the numbers.
- **Error detection became easier**, as it is possible to see which numbers are being multiplied and added to which cell.

## 5- Suggestions and Future Work

- Users should be able to **manually input their matrices**.
- The animation speed should be **adjustable**.
- **Undo** and **stop** functions can be added.
  
## 6- Conclusion
In this study, a simple site was developed to show matrix multiplication step by step using D3.js. Thanks to the visualization, the process of matrix multiplication became more understandable.
